# PIC16F887A-LOGIN-
This project implements a simple login system using a PIC16F887 microcontroller, a 4x4 matrix keypad, and a character LCD. 
The user is prompted to enter a 4-digit password using the keypad, and the entered password is compared with a predefined one. 
If the passwords match, a "Login Successful" message is displayed on the LCD; otherwise, an "Incorrect Password" message is shown.
